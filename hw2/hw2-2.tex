  First, to do this problem we must define a new $\delta$ function, which we'll call $\delta_2$. It is to represent the state transitions for $L^R$, and it's defined as : $\delta_2(p,a) = \{q | \delta(q,a) = p, q \in Q\}$. Then our new NFA is defined as follows:
  $$Q^N = Q \times Q \cup q_0^N$$
  $$\Sigma^N = \Sigma$$
  $$\delta^N(q_0^N, \epsilon) = \{(q_0, r), r \in F\}$$
  $$\delta^N((p,q), a) = (\delta(p,a), \delta_2(q,a))$$
  $$q_0^N$$
  $$F^N = \{(p,q) | \delta(p,a) = q, \delta_2(q,a) = p, p \in Q, q \in Q\, \text{ for some } a \in \Sigma\}$$

  Essentially all the NFA is doing is that it has several ``starting'' points, where it marks two indices: one is the index of $q_0$, and the other is an element from $F$, and the idea is that the two will walk towards each other.\\\\
  To actually implement multiple possible starting points \footnote{https://piazza.com/class/i4mrvddxr0h3sd?cid=265}, I just have an artificial $q_0^N$ that $\epsilon$ transitions to all of the starting points that I want.\\\\
  The two walk towards each other, with the first index incrementing with the forwards $\delta$, and the second index decrementing with the backward $\delta_2$. Eventually they reach a point where they're one transition away from one another, at the last character of $w$. At this point, we see that the set of final states has this case included, and we can return successfully.\\
