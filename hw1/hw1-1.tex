\begin{enumerate}
\item
  I'll be inducting on the number of operations to construct a regular language.\\\\

  Base Case:\\
  The base case is when the number of operations to construct the regular language is $n = 1$. The only way to get a regular language of a single operation is through the base case of the inductive definition of regular languages:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\emptyset$ is represented by a top-plus regular expression, of the form ($\alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_k$), where k = 1, because $\alpha_1 = \emptyset$ contains no `+'
  \item $\{\epsilon\}$, is also represented by a top-plus expression, again where k = 1, where $\alpha_1 = \epsilon$ contains no `+'.
  \item $\{a\}$, for any $a$ in any arbitrary alphabet, $\Sigma$, is represented by a top-plus expression, where k = 1, where $\alpha_1 = a$ contains no `+'
  \end{itemize}
  Inductive Hypothesis:\\
  Now assume for all regular languages, where the number of operations to construct is $1 \leq k < n$, that they can be represented by a top-plus regular expression.\\\\
  Inductive Step:\\
  Without loss of generality, let $r_{n-1}$ be any regular expression (representing a regular language) that was constructed in $(n-1)$ steps.
