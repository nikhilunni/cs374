  So the algorithm starts out with two indices, i and j, pointing to 1 and n respectively, to encompass the entire initial problem. You can see the correct initial call for the problem, at the top : KSHOT(p,n,k) = $K(p,1,n,k, \emptyset)$. At every stage, the algorithm has a choice to include i in the list of pairs, or move on, where the second index, x, is anything between i+1 and j, inclusive -- in this case, the method is recursively called with the correct indices, a value of k-1, and the strategy so far is the same thing appended with this new $(b_i,s_i)$ tuple.\\

  Or, the algorithm can move on an index, by skipping the current i, and moving on to i+1, with the rest of the parameters the same.\\

  If we've already exhausted the total number of strategies so far, or if we've decremented k, k times (or if k == 0), or if we've reached the bound of our indices i and j, then the algorithm returns 0 to show that it is nonoptimal (yet still better than a negative choice).\\

  I've written out the pseudocode for the same function, although it only calculates the value of the winning k-shot (off by a factor of 1000 from the real value) merely to show the evaluation order. To actually get the set of k-shots, keep track of the set with each recursive call, like in the mathematical formalization above.\\

  As for the actual memoization, there are only $O(kn^2)$ unique problems, and they're all of the substrings of the array p, given the current number of k-shots we have left. We can see this by the indices i,j, and k. The memoization structure woud be a 3D array of size nxnxk, where each position represents the value of K(i,j,k), as the max value of k-shots between a given i and j are also dictated by how many k-shots we are permitted at most. Because each problem takes O(1) time to evaluate, just simple addition and subtraction, in total, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(kn^2)$.
